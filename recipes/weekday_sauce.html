            <li>1 Can Whole Peeled Plum Tomatoes</li>
            <li>3 Garlic Clove</li>

            <li>Salt to taste</li>            
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a food mill (or Blender) - Add the whole can of tomatoes to the food mill and process the tomatoes until you are left with a thin, smooth consistency</li>
            <li>Thinly slice the garlic cloves</li>
            <li>In a large skillet or medium-sized pot, enough olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan on a medium heat</li>            
            <li>Add the sausage and brown on each side on medium heat</li>
            <li>Transfer the sausage to a plate once its browned and then add garlic and basil to the pan</li>
            <li>Cook for 2-3 minutes until the garlic begins to brown around the edges</li>
            <li>Then add the tomato puree</li>
            <li>Bring the heat to medium-high and continue to stir and once simmering, add the sausage back to the sauce and slowly simmer until the sauce is thickened and the sausage is cooked through. If the sausage cooks through before the sauce has thickened, remove the sauce and continue cooking the sauce. The sausage is cooked through at 160 degrees F. The sauce should be thick but not too thick. Adjust the salt to taste and then plate</li>
            <li>Plate with tomatoes sauce, Parmigiano Reggiano, and fresh basil</li>            
        </ol>
