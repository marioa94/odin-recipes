    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite ways to make a steak especially with a cheaper cut. It includes some red wine sauce with calabrian chili peppers to give it a spicy kick. Full of flavor and a kick. An easy way to impress your guests.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 strip steak</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup Dry Marsala</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup Red Wine</li>
        <li>2 cloves of Garlic, Grated</li>
        <li>2 TBSP Avocado oil or high smoke point oil</li>
        <li>2 TBSP chopped Calabrian chilies, finely minced with 1-2 TBSP of the liquid they are packed in</li>
        <li>2 TBSP finely chopped Parsley</li>
        <li>1/2 TBSP Cold Unsalted Butter</li>  
        <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>      
        <li>If cooking for more than one person: 2 cups of stock</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Salt the steak on both sides and let it sit in the fridge uncovered.</li>
        <li>Now get the stainless steel pan preheated over medium heat. While that heats up, I’m gonna just pat the steak dry just to ensure there is no residence moisture left. If you didn’t salt the steak already, do so now.</li>
        <li>nce the pan is hot, I’m just gonna hit the steak with a little bit more salt and then get some avocado oil in the pan, just a tablespoon or so and place the steak on the fat side. This will render out some fat that we can use to sear the meat along with the boil. Once the fat is browned, place the steak on one side of the pan and let it sear for about 1 minute. After a minute. Flip the steak and move it t the other side of the pan. This is now the hotter side. And while the steak cooks there, the other side can catch but up in terms of temperature. Just make sure you are managing the heat during this process. This makes sure we get a great sear while using moderate heat.</li>
        <li>Keep searing and flipping every minute or so and depending on the thickness of the steak and desired doneness, it should take about 6-8 minutes. If using a thermometer, pulling it at 125-130 degrees and resting should give you a nice medium -medium-rare. Get the steak out of the pan and drain the oil. Then get the chilis and garlic in the pan. Cook it for a minute or two until it's very fragrant then kill the heat and add 1/2 cup each of the marsala and the red wine. Cook that for a few minutes and then use your nose to test and make sure the alcohol is cooked out, Then add the tomato paste. If you’re making this for a few people, I’d either add a few more tablespoons of this tomato puree and a cup or two of stock to ensure you have enough sauce. Then reduce until it's thickened.</li>
